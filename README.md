## **2/18**
* 8am - 9pm: getting repo set up + planning the day
* 9am - 5pm  [practice project](https://github.com/karenaxon/portfolio-react.git). Portfolio with React, Sanity, Tailwind. Please see the repo for commits.
  
### **Issues encountered with practice project:**
* [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO7_jgzVgbc&list=PL76mI9stnSrjW0MFLAAz1Phz5Uvhdcfgf&index=4) is only 1 year old but instructions are already outdated.
* Issues connecting Sanity to react project.
* Issues installing the correct Tailwind package & spend time learning how to use the plug-ins.
* Issues with "CRLF will be replaced by LF" that were preventing commits to be pushed to the repo.
* Issues with Sanity's project node-modules being tracked by git, even though the folder is included in the gitignore.
* Issues with react routing not working. Had to uninstall the node-modules for it to work.
  
### **New/Cool Things:**
* [ React social icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons)
