## **2/18**
* 8am - 9pm: getting repo set up + planning the day
* 9am - 5pm  [practice project](https://github.com/karenaxon/portfolio-react.git). Portfolio with React, Sanity, Tailwind. Please see the repo for commits.
  
### **Issues encountered with practice project:**
* [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO7_jgzVgbc&list=PL76mI9stnSrjW0MFLAAz1Phz5Uvhdcfgf&index=4) is only 1 year old but instructions are already outdated.
* Issues connecting Sanity to react project.
* Issues installing the correct Tailwind package & spend time learning how to use the plug-ins.
* Issues with "CRLF will be replaced by LF" that were preventing commits to be pushed to the repo.
* Issues with Sanity's project node-modules being tracked by git, even though the folder is included in the gitignore.
* Issues with react routing not working. Had to uninstall the node-modules for it to work.
  
### **New/Cool Things:**
* [ React social icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons)

## **2/25**
* 8am - 9pm: getting Glimpse repo set up + planning the application
* 9am - 10am: put project chart image and README to together. 
* 10am - 10:45: setting up Sanity studio project and troubleshooting "The git repository at XXXX has too many active changes, only a subset of Git features will be enabled." Which hopefully will be resolved by adding a gitignore to the backend folder.
* 10:45am - 5pm: See [Glimpse]("https://github.com/karenaxon/glimpse.git") repo for commits.
  
### **Issues encountered:**
* In the morning I encountered some issues mainly because I divided the project into a frontend(react) folder and a backend(sanity) folder. Git had a hard time with the setup and didn't know what files were tracked/not tracked or had been edited. My work around was to include a gitignore file in each of the folders and upload these to the repo in their corresponding folders.

### **New/Cool Things:**

* [React loader spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner)
* [React Masonry CSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-css)
