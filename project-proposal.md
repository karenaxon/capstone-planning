### Additional Info About This Project

I grew up in a rural town in Guatemala and elementary school teachers there could use an app to organize and share assignment details (images) with students through WhatsApp; which is widely used and easy/cheap to access there. This real world problem propelled me to put this site together. I am not sure how this app would interact with WhatsApp (or if it is even possible) but working on this app is a start to figuring it out. An app for educators is needed because currently they don't have a centralized place to organize assignments and to track what has been shared with students through WhatsApp and what hasn't.
